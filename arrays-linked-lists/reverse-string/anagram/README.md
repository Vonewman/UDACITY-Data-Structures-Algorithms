# Anagrams

The goal is to write some code to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.

An anagram is a word (or phrase) that is formed by rearranging the letters of another word (or phrase).

For example:

	* "rat" is an anagram of "art"
	* "alert" is an anagram of "alter"
	* "Slot machines" is an anagram of "Cash lost in me"
	
Our function should take two as input and return `True` if the two words are anagrams anf `False` if they are not.

You can assume the following about the following about the input strings:

	* No punctuation
	* No numbers
	* No special characters
